## 🧬 What Is This?

AI Disease is a **self-hosted command & control platform** for autonomous social media agents. You give it accounts, you give it missions, and it gets to work — sending messages, accepting friend requests, posting content, engaging with people — all without you lifting a finger.

Each agent operates **independently and asynchronously**. They don't waste tokens sitting idle — they know when to act and when to wait. If someone hasn't replied yet, the agent moves on and circles back later. If a friend request is still pending, it doesn't burn cycles refreshing — it checks back on a smart schedule.

You can run **one agent or a hundred**. Each one can have its own personality, its own mission, its own accounts. They coordinate when needed and stay out of each other's way when they don't.

> 💡 Think of it as your own private army of social media operators — tireless, obedient, and smart enough to pass as human.

### The Flow

1. 🎨 **You create agents** — give them names, personalities, behavior profiles
2. 🔗 **You link accounts** — attach Facebook, Instagram, Telegram accounts to each agent
3. 🎯 **You define missions** — broad ("spread awareness about topic X") or surgical ("DM these 200 people with message Y")
4. 🚀 **Agents execute autonomously** — they log in, navigate, perform actions, handle obstacles, adapt on the fly
5. 👁️ **You observe** — real-time dashboard shows every action, every decision, every result

---

## 🎯 Mission System

Missions are the heart of AI Disease. A mission is a **high-level objective** that the agent's DeepSeek brain autonomously decomposes into executable steps.

### 📋 Mission Types

| | Type | What It Does | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| 📢 | **Spread the Word** | Post about a topic across groups, walls, stories. Engage in comment sections with relevant takes. | *"Promote our new crypto project in 50 Polish Facebook groups"* |
| 🤝 | **Network Builder** | Send friend requests to targeted profiles, accept incoming ones, grow the network strategically. | *"Add 100 people from Warsaw interested in fitness"* |
| 💬 | **Messenger Outreach** | DM a list of people with personalized messages. Follow up if no reply. Handle conversations. | *"Message all group members about our event, follow up after 48h"* |
| ❤️ | **Engagement Farm** | Like, comment, share content matching keywords or from specific pages/profiles. | *"Engage with every post mentioning 'AI tools' in the last 24h"* |
| 👁️ | **Surveillance** | Monitor specific profiles, groups, or hashtags. Report activity, new posts, or keyword mentions. | *"Watch competitor's page, alert me when they post about pricing"* |
| 🎭 | **Persona Builder** | Warm up an account — post content, add friends, join groups, build a believable history. | *"Make this new account look like a real 25-year-old from Krakow"* |
| 📊 | **Data Harvester** | Scrape public profiles, group member lists, post engagement data, and export as structured data. | *"Export all members of these 10 Facebook groups as CSV"* |
| 🔄 | **Auto-Responder** | Monitor inbox and respond to incoming messages using AI-generated contextual replies. | *"Reply to all DMs about our product with helpful info"* |
| 📝 | **Content Creator** | Generate and post original content — text, image descriptions, stories — on a schedule. | *"Post 3 motivational quotes daily to Instagram with relevant hashtags"* |
| 🎯 | **Custom Script** | Define a precise sequence of actions — the agent follows your exact playbook step by step. | *"Go to profile X → like last 5 posts → send message Y → wait for reply"* |

### ⚙️ Mission Properties

```yaml
mission:
  name: "Warsaw Fitness Outreach"
  type: messenger_outreach
  priority: high
  agents: [agent_1, agent_2]          # Assign multiple agents

  target:
    source: group                      # Where to find targets
    group_url: "fb.com/groups/..."
    filters:
      location: "Warsaw"
      gender: "any"
      active_in_last_days: 30

  message:
    template: "Hey {first_name}! Saw you're into fitness..."
    personalize: true                  # AI adapts message per person
    follow_up_after_hours: 48
    max_follow_ups: 2

  limits:
    messages_per_day: 30               # Stay under radar
    hours_active: ["9:00", "22:00"]    # Only operate during human hours
    cooldown_minutes: 5                # Min gap between actions

  schedule:
    start: "2026-03-01 09:00"
    repeat: daily
    until: "2026-04-01"
```

Missions run **to completion**. If an agent gets blocked, rate-limited, or needs to wait for a human response — it pauses intelligently and resumes when conditions are right. **No token waste. No blind retrying.**

## 🔧 Requirements

> ⚠️ Before you start, make sure you have these four things:

| | Requirement | Details |
|---|---|---|
| 💪 | **Courage** | You're automating real social media accounts. Understand the risks. Accounts can get banned. Use burner accounts or accept the consequences. |
| 🪙 | **DeepSeek API Tokens** | The AI brain behind every agent. Dirt cheap, blazing fast, uncensored enough for the job. Get your key → [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com) |
| 🖥️ | **A VPS with Root Access** | Full control over your server is non-negotiable. The platform manages browser instances, proxies, cron jobs, and system-level automation. Recommended: Hetzner, OVH, Contabo, or any provider where you get actual root. |
| 🐧 | **Ubuntu Linux** | Built for Ubuntu 22.04+. Debian-based distros will probably work. Anything else — you're on your own. |

### 💻 Recommended VPS Specs

| Agents | RAM | CPU | Storage | Estimated Monthly Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1–3 | 2 GB | 2 vCPU | 40 GB SSD | ~$4–6 |
| 4–10 | 4 GB | 4 vCPU | 80 GB SSD | ~$8–12 |
| 10–30 | 8 GB | 6 vCPU | 120 GB SSD | ~$15–25 |
| 30–100 | 16 GB+ | 8+ vCPU | 200 GB+ SSD | ~$30–50 |

> 💡 Each agent runs a headless Chromium instance. RAM is your main bottleneck. Budget ~200MB per idle agent, ~500MB per active one.

## 🧠 Agent Intelligence

Agents aren't just dumb bots following scripts. Each agent has a **DeepSeek-powered brain** that handles:

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| 💬 **Conversational AI** | Generate contextual, natural replies in any language. Maintain conversation history and personality consistency. |
| 🎯 **Decision Making** | Evaluate situations and choose the best action. Should I send this person a message? Is this group worth posting in? |
| 🧩 **Mission Decomposition** | Break high-level objectives ("grow my network") into concrete executable steps. |
| 🔍 **Content Analysis** | Read and understand posts, comments, profiles. Extract relevant information for targeting. |
| ✍️ **Content Generation** | Write posts, comments, messages that match the agent's persona and mission objectives. |
| 🛡️ **Threat Detection** | Recognize suspicious patterns — potential bans, CAPTCHAs, unusual platform behavior — and adapt accordingly. |
| 🌐 **Multi-Language** | Operate natively in any language. Auto-detect and match the language of conversations. |
| 🎭 **Persona Maintenance** | Stay in character. Remember past interactions. Build a consistent, believable online presence over time. |

### 🪙 Token Efficiency

AI is **only invoked when the agent needs to think**:

```
Routine action (click, scroll, navigate) → Hard-coded logic     → 0 tokens
Simple decision (accept friend request)  → Rule-based engine    → 0 tokens
Complex decision (what to reply)         → DeepSeek API call    → minimal tokens
Content generation (write a post)        → DeepSeek API call    → minimal tokens
```

> 💰 Typical cost: **$0.01–0.05 per agent per day** depending on mission complexity.

## 🛡️ Anti-Detection Suite

Staying undetected is **the #1 priority**. AI Disease includes a full anti-detection stack:

| Layer | What It Does |
|---|---|
| 🖥️ **Browser Fingerprinting** | Randomized canvas, WebGL, AudioContext, fonts, screen resolution, timezone, language per session. |
| 🖱️ **Human Behavior Engine** | Bezier-curve mouse movements, variable typing speed (with typos!), natural scroll patterns, random pauses. |
| ⏱️ **Session Patterns** | Agents don't run 24/7. They have "wake up" and "sleep" times. They take breaks. They browse randomly between tasks. |
| 🔀 **Proxy Rotation** | Automatic IP rotation per session or per action. Support for HTTP, SOCKS5, and residential proxies. |
| 🍪 **Cookie Management** | Persistent sessions that look like returning users, not fresh logins every time. |
| 📱 **Device Profiles** | Simulate different devices — desktop, mobile, tablet — with matching User-Agents and viewport sizes. |
| 🧬 **Behavioral Randomization** | No two agents act the same. Action order, timing, and patterns are randomized within human-plausible bounds. |
